                <p>Code Savvy is a non-profit organization built to inspire kids and teens to become code-savvy. We create and foster programs and services that help kids understand the kind of creative thinking that goes into coding, and to experience programming computers and devices. By doing this, Code Savvy is determined to bring more gender and ethnic diversity to computer science.</p>
                <p>Code Savvy achieves its mission by supporting a number of open and free coding classes such as the Twin Cities CoderDojo, the girls-only Rebecca CoderDojo and various local coder clubs. It also facilitates Technovation[MN], a local app development competition for local teen girls. Code Savvy also offers services and programs for educators through its Get With The Program workshops, Educators Cohort, and the Coding In The Classroom Summit.</p>
                <p>Code Savvy is a central resource for local advocates and champions for the advancement of youth computer science. Through its connections and vision, it is able to activate programs and services that give real-world coding experience to the kids who need it most.</p>

                        <p>Code Savvy was founded by Rebecca Schatz, a serial entrepreneur in the not-for-profit space. In addition to Code Savvy she founded The Works hands-on museum of engineering, and was the catalyst behind Technovation[MN]. She passed away in 2015.</p>
                        <p>Rebecca touched so many people during her vibrant, innovative, and inspiring life. She left an an inspiring, sustainable, and lasting legacy to encourage kids and teens to explore their curiosity, learn coding and creative problem solving, and for the the volunteers, family members, and mentors who make it happen.</p>
                        <p>Rebecca built systems and organizations and more importantly she engaged others to participate in the process. She knew that change is the work of many and she inspired everyone to stretch, grow and develop themselves. Her outreach was inherently about inclusion – helping kids see new models and pathways to pursue their own passion, dreams and careers in new and accessible ways. Rebecca brought passion and a focused commitment to inspire our youth to explore and discover engineering, science and coding in hands-on environments.</p>
                        <p>In early July 2015, Code Savvy appointed Jean Weiss the Executive Director of Code Savvy to carry forward Rebecca’s vision to inspire a diverse new code savvy generation.</p>
