# Square1 - base code for a Metalsmith site

This is an example of an initial Metalsmith site. The build workflow uses Gulp and Metalsmith. All asset compilation is done with Gulp and the site is assembled with Metalsmith.

This project is a work-in-progress. As I build sites I'll expand on Square1. 

## Installation
````
git clone https://github.com/wernerglinka/square1.git
run npm install
gulp
````

After running `gulp` the site will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

All testing has been done on MacOS. If you use Window you are on your own.
